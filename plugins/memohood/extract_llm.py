"""Gemini flash-lite extraction/judging calls for memohood's two-stage capture
pipeline (DESIGN_v1.md capture.py step 2: "Borderline band ... -> ONE Gemini
flash-lite call") and three-tier supersede classifier (HERMES_UPGRADES.md
§1.8 item 11 / gbrain's ``facts/classify.ts``: "cosine >= 0.95 -> дубль без
LLM; иначе дешёвая модель решает duplicate|supersede|independent").

Model/endpoint per this project's non-negotiables and HERMES_UPGRADES.md
§1.3's accepted decision: ``gemini-2.5-flash-lite`` via the OpenAI-compatible
REST surface at
``https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions``,
authenticated with ``GEMINI_API_KEY`` (confirmed already present in
``$HERMES_HOME/.env`` per HERMES_UPGRADES.md §1.3) as an OpenAI-style Bearer
token — NOT Google's native ``x-goog-api-key`` header, since the whole point
of using the OpenAI-compat surface is a plain ``chat/completions`` shape
callers elsewhere in this project (embed.py/rerank.py) already know how to
drive.

Every call: browser-like User-Agent (reusing ``_engine.security.
DEFAULT_USER_AGENT``), a timeout, and exponential backoff on 429/5xx — this
project's "every external HTTP call" non-negotiable. Two public entry
points:

    judge(new_content, candidates, *, conn=None) -> dict
        {"action": "duplicate"|"supersede"|"independent",
         "supersedes_id": str | None, "reasoning": str}
        Used by capture.py's three-tier supersede classifier for the
        "cosine is in the ambiguous 0.92-0.95 band" case — the cheap-first
        cosine tiers (>=0.95 dup, <0.92 independent) never reach this
        function at all, per the classifier's own cost-control design.

    extract(turn_text, *, conn=None) -> dict | None
        {"is_memorable": bool, "kind": str, "notability": "high"|"medium"|
         "low", "source_type": "EXTRACTED"|"INFERRED", "pinned": bool}
        Used by capture.py's two-stage gate for turns that scored in the
        "borderline" band between definite-keep and definite-drop on the
        free keyword-signal pass. Returns None if the turn is empty/
        whitespace-only (no call made) or if the LLM call ultimately fails
        after retries (degrade to "skip capture", never crash the turn).

A third entry point, added for ``consolidate.py``'s nightly rollup
(HERMES_UPGRADES.md §1.3 "Ночной rollup через hermes cron ... Gemini
flash-lite"):

    summarize(texts, *, level="day", conn=None) -> str | None
        One Gemini flash-lite call that consolidates a time-bucket's worth
        of capture contents into a single durable paragraph, for
        ``consolidate.py``'s day->week->month rollup. Returns ``None`` on
        an empty input list or any call failure (missing key, network,
        unparseable reply) — never raises.

Both functions fence the untrusted turn/candidate text via
``_engine.security.fence_untrusted`` before sending it to Gemini (DESIGN_v1.md
step 3: "Injection-sanitize the turn text IN ... (security.scan/fence)") and
scrub the model's own JSON reply through ``_engine.security.scan_secrets``
before returning it (the "... and the extracted fact OUT" half of that same
step) — a capture whose ``content``/``reasoning`` field itself contains a
secret-shaped string is logged and the field is redacted, never silently
passed through to ``captures.content``/the recall path.

Neither function ever raises for a normal LLM/network failure — see each
docstring for the exact degrade contract. This mirrors ``_engine.rerank``'s
"a paid external call degrading to a safe default is normal operation, not
an error" design, since Gemini flash-lite's free tier has its own rate
limits a live bot can hit.
