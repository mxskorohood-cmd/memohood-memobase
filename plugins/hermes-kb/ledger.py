"""KB external-spend ledger (HERMES_UPGRADES.md §1.9 gap #7).

Cloudflare (embed) and Cohere (rerank) calls happen entirely outside
hermes-core's own token-guard/cost hooks (they are plain HTTP calls this
plugin makes, not LLM API calls hermes tracks) — so this module is the ONLY
place their dollar cost is recorded and capped.

Public surface (used by embed.py, rerank.py, ingest.py):

    record_call(conn, provider, op, units=None, est_usd=None, collection_id=None) -> int
    estimate_cost_usd(provider, op, units) -> float
    check_monthly_ceiling(conn, provider, memobase_cfg) -> (within_ceiling, spent_so_far, ceiling)
    ensure_within_ceiling(conn, provider, memobase_cfg)  # raises LedgerError if already over

Pricing is a best-effort estimate (API_CONTRACT_PLUGINS.md §3 precedent:
"best-effort" cost estimation is the accepted standard here too) — these
constants should be reviewed periodically against the providers' current
published pricing, not treated as billing-accurate.
